    - 'XX_REF' for groups
    - 'XX_REF_[layer name]' for layers
- Yellow layers corresponds to 'UTIL' and should be named :
    - 'XX_UTIL' for groups
    - 'XX_UTIL_[layer name]' for layers
- Blue layers corresponds to 'BG' and should be named :
    - '[group number]_BG' for groups
    - '[group number]_[layer number]_BG _[layer name]' for layers
- Red layers corresponds to 'CH' and should be named :
    - '[group number]_CH' for groups
    - '[group number]_[layer number]_CH _[layer name]' for layers
