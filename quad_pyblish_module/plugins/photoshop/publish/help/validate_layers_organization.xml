## Invalid Organzation

Layers aren't properly organized:

- Layers must all be in ONE group
- No groups are allowed in groups

Or you have color problem of your layers, only the following are autorized:

- REF = Green
- UTIL = Yellow
- BG = Bleue
- CH = Red
- PNG = Violet

### How to repair?

You can select the default layers with the "Select Layers" button on the right and correct them.
